**Initial Automated Server Security Configuration**

This project provides a set of scripts to automate the initial hardening of a server. The scripts are designed to be generic and can be used on a variety of Linux and Windows servers.

We request you to read the script before executing. You have to change the script accoring to your need.

The scripts cover the following hardening tasks:

* Remove unnecessary software and packages
* Keep the system up to date
* Enable the firewall
* Disable unused services
* Use strong passwords
* Enable two-factor authentication for all supported accounts

The scripts also include a number of security checks to ensure that the hardening process has been successful.

To use the scripts, simply clone the GitHub repository to your server and run the appropriate script for your operating system.

**Benefits of using this project:**

* Save time and effort by automating the hardening process
* Reduce the risk of human error
* Ensure that your server is hardened to a consistent standard

**How to use this project:**

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your server:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/initial-automated-hardening-of-server.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts:

```
cd initial-automated-hardening-of-server
```

3. Run the appropriate script for your operating system:

```
# Redhat Linux
./rhel-hardening.sh

# Ubuntu Linux
./ubuntu-hardening.sh

# Windows
./windows-hardening.ps

# Apache/HTTPD Webserver 
./apache2-hardening.sh
./httpd-hardening.sh
```

4. Follow the instructions on the screen.

**Additional notes:**

* The scripts will prompt you for your password when they need to perform tasks that require root privileges.
* It is important to carefully review the output of the scripts to ensure that they have performed the desired tasks correctly.
* You can customize the scripts to meet your specific needs and requirements.

This project is intended to be a starting point for hardening your servers. You may need to perform additional hardening tasks depending on your specific environment and requirements.
